---  Setting up MongoDB with Docker
https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2019/01/getting-started-mongodb-docker-container-deployment/

1.) docker pull mongo
2.) docker run -d -p 27017-27019:27017-27019 --name test_db mongo
Runs in detached mode (in the background)
We are also mapping the container ports with host ports so that way we can access the database from a host level application if we wanted to.
3.) To interact with it:
docker exec -it test_db bash
4.) Now that you're in the container, crack open the mongodb shell:
mongo
use jpnews
db.day.save(the struct)
db.day.find({ "id": 1 })
db.day.find({"date": "2021-05-11"})
--- Asahi vs NHK
Their Item structs are the same except what the date is labeled in xml. This causes a lot of redundant code, is there a way
around this....
